# LaseR

You need Rtools installed beforehand.
Furthermore, you need the package devtools to perform these commands in R:
- Download in R: `devtools::install_github('juliusfoerstel/LaseR')`
- Load package: `library(LaseR)`

Just install all the packages, that might seem to be missing along the way...
