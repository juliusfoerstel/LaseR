#' Opens the tikzDevice in the graphics folder of the MA
#'
#' This function opens and loads the tikzDevice to create a tikz output for a plot. It uses therein the function create.graphics.path()
#' also from the LaseR-package.
#' @param filename A string which is going to be the name of the output file. Default value is "RPlot"
#'   @param     width numeric Width of the plot in inches. Default is 4.

#' @examples
#' plot.for.ma(filename = "Signalst√§rke", width = 4, height = 4)
#' 
#' This creates a new file called Signal_intensities.tex in the folder where the graphics for the Tex-file are stored.
#' Afterwards the plotting has to be done and in the end the device has to be closed by dev.off().
